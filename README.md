# LFR-based-maze-solver
This code in particular is written to clear the zonals of meshmerize conducted by IIT Bombay as such it currently lacks obstacle detection and avoidance
It follows a bunch of different shortest path alogrithm
  1) LSRB(left,straight,right,back)
  2) DFS
  3) BFS
  4) Dijkstra
